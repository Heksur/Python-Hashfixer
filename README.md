                    # This tool was created to make dividing hashes etc easily.#
                    # It will make a bash-script named AWK Hash Fix.sh  #
                    # Basically it's easy-mode awk. #
                    # CTRL+C at any time to stop. #

                    # What is its position relevant to the dividing character you'd like to remove? #
                    # Example: user:email:hash:salt:pass                                            #
                    # You'd like user and pass? You would type in: 1 (enter) 5 (enter) : (enter)    #

					# Python-Hashfixer V2#

		# This tool is the better version of the above script, which currently doesn't support picking a piece of information, but already splits it up in a more read-able format.
		# You insert a delimiter (eg: :) without any quotes and it's good to go.
